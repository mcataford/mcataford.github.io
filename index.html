      <p>Hey there! My name is Marc.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="header_blurb">
      <p>I am a 25 years old computer engineering major student at McGill University (Montreal, CAN). I also minor
      in mathematics out of playful curiosity. Originally a physiology and mathematics double-major, bioinformatics-
      related courses sparked my interest for all things computer systems and I promptly changed faculty to
      pursue my new passion. I strive to have as broad a skillset as possible, which brought me to explore
      hardware, computer software and recently, web development.</p>
      <p>My biggest tech thrills revolve around playing with microcontrollers, finding ways to use multiple
      technologies to get the job done as efficiently as possible and producing well-designed solutions to
      the problems that land on my desk.</p>
      <p>I'm also a pretty big fan of professional cycling, obstacle course racing and healthy cooking.</p>
