						<p>Hi! My name is <strong>Marc</strong> and I am a tinkerer/teacher/developer/engineering student.</p>
						<p>I do a lot of things. I'm currently the chairperson and webmaster of the <a title="I live to serve since 1911" href="https://www.dailypublications.org">Daily Publications Society</a>, a non-profit organization that publishes two weekly print &amp; online student newspapers in the McGill community, the Editor-in-chief at <a title="We also organize artsy events." href="https://graphitepublications.com">Graphite Publications</a>, an independent Montreal-based online publication that tries really hard to do something different from its peers, and the web developer in charge of the clubs &amp; services of the <a title="Protector of WordPress Realms, Herder of Plugins." href="http://www.ssmu.ca">Students' Society of McGill University</a>. Oh, and I teach Java, Python and Intro. to Web development at <a title="More than 120 happy students since Fall 2016" href="http://ssmu.mcgill.ca/minicourses/">SSMU MiniCourses</a> to curious students to unwind.</p>
						<p>I do a whole bunch of other things, check out my <a href="#">résumé</a> to know what I've been up to lately.</p>
						<p>If you want to chat, work on some cool problems or write, hit me up at <a href="mailto:marc@marccataford.com">marc@marccataford.com</a>!</p>
