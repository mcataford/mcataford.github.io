    <h1>Hello, I'm Marc.</h1>
  </aside>

  <p>My name is Marc and I am a <strong>Computer Engineering</strong> student at <strong>McGill University</strong> planning to graduate in May 2018. I am always open to hear about projects I could pitch into and would like to find <strong>full-time employment</strong> in the <strong>Toronto area</strong> starting <strong>Summer 2018</strong>. In the meantime, I would love to</p>

<h1 id="formal-training">Formal training</h1>

<p>During my engineering training, I have worked extensively with <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>C/C++</strong>, used <strong>MATLAB</strong> a handful of times and dabbled with <strong>analog and digital electronics</strong> using the <strong>Arduino</strong> and <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong> platforms. My coursework included experimentation with <strong>robotics</strong> through the Java-based Lego Mindstorms system and PIC microcontrollers/hand-soldered analog circuits, <strong>digital systems architecture</strong> using FPGAs and <strong>game development</strong> in the context of my senior design project which consists in the elaboration of a real-time news game engine for <a href="http://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/tb2-malis-ancient-manuscripts">TB2: Mali’s Ancient Manuscripts</a>, in collaboration with <a href="https://http://pulitzercenter.org">The Pulitzer Center</a>.</p>

<h1 id="journalism">Journalism</h1>

<p>Between 2014 and 2017, I have served as <strong>Web editor</strong> at <a href="https://www.mcgilldaily.com">The McGill Daily</a>, one of Canada’s oldest university publications, continually publishing since the early 1911. During my tenure, I handled web development requests related to any web content we published, and maintained the publication’s website and social media presence. I have also singlehandedly rebuild the website in the Summer of 2016 to meet new requirements from the editorial team.</p>

<p>Since 2016, I have been involved in <a href="https://www.dailypublications.org">The Daily Publications’ Society</a> Board of Directors, first as an editorial representative to The Daily and then as the <strong>Society’s Chairperson</strong>, starting July 2017.</p>

<h1 id="teaching">Teaching</h1>

<p>I have taught French for seven years at <a href="http://www.cvm.qc.ca/activitesservices/soutienReussite/caf/Pages/index.aspx">Cégep du Vieux-Montréal</a> before starting to tutor and teach programming. I have been a <a href="https://www.chegg.com/tutors/">Chegg Tutors</a> tutor since 2013, providing assistance to hundreds of students with their Java, C/C++, Python, PHP, Javascript, MATLAB, Assembly and web development assignments, and taught introductory Python, Java and Web development for four semesters at the <a href="http://ssmu.mcgill.ca/minicourses/">Students’ Society of McGill University’s MiniCourses program</a>.</p>
